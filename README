DESCRIPTION

Game experiment of a little guy hopping around from moons or asteroids using a
grappling hook.


PLATFORMS

I am developing on linux and this is my primary target. And since this is an
experiment I may not put in the effort to make it platform independent if I feel
it is not going anywhere. However, I am developing it with the goal that if I
want to make it platform independent in the future it should be fairly
straightforward. To this end I am trying to use platform independent libraries
in conjunction with CMake.


DEPENDENCIES

Moonhooper depends upon the following libraries:
- glfw
- GL
- GLU
- boost
- libpng
- tinyxml

Tinyxml is a special case. It is included as part of the source code because I
had a strange situation with library locations on different machines, which was
easiest to solve by including tinyxml in the source and compiling it into a
shared library.
