DESCRIPTION

Game experiment of a little guy hopping around from moons or asteroids using a
grappling hook.


PLATFORMS

I am developing on linux and this is my primary target. And since this is an
experiment I may not put in the effort to make it platform independent if I feel
it is not going anywhere. However, I am developing it with the goal that if I
want to make it platform independent in the future it should be fairly
straightforward. To this end I am trying to use platform independent libraries
in conjunction with CMake.


DEPENDENCIES

Moonhooper depends upon the following libraries:
- glfw
- GL
- GLU
- boost
- libpng
- tinyxml

Tinyxml is a special case. It is included as part of the source code because I
had a strange situation with library locations on different machines, which was
easiest to solve by including tinyxml in the source and compiling it into a
shared library.


TO RUN THE GAME

To run the game from the top level directory,

./bin/moonhopper --resources resources/ --config default.cfg

The --resource flag specifies where the resources directory is relative to the
binary executable. The --config flag specifies the configuration to use, which
must be located in the resources directory although it can be named differently.
The configuration file specifies many of the parameters that are used to
customize the behavior of the game.
